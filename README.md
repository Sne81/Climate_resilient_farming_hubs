# Climate-Resilient Farming Hubs

A decentralized, community-based, and AI-powered farming system integrating regenerative agriculture practices, efficient water management, and eco-friendly pest control. Climate change challenges agriculture with unpredictable weather, water scarcity, and increased pests. This project combines traditional farming wisdom with modern technology to create resilient agricultural networks. Key features include regenerative agriculture that improves soil health and biodiversity, efficient water management to optimize water use and reduce waste, eco-friendly pest control to minimize chemical use and protect beneficial insects, a community-based approach that engages local farmers in collaborative decision-making, and AI-powered insights that provide actionable information for farmers.

The project structure includes sample data files in the `data/` directory, source code for predictions in the `src/` directory, and Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. To get started, you need Python 3.x and Git. Installation involves cloning the repository, optionally creating and activating a virtual environment, and installing the required packages. Running the prediction script is straightforward: navigate to the `src` directory and execute the script.

The `data/sample_data.csv` file contains environmental data for training and testing AI models, including columns for temperature, humidity, soil moisture, water usage, and pest incidence. Contributions are welcome! To contribute, fork the repository, clone your forked repository, create a new branch, make your changes, commit them, push your changes, and create a pull request.
